  "port_scan": "Overview: \nPort Scanning allows you to find which ports are open or closed in a network. In networking, a port serves as a communication endpoint for different types of traffic. Think of it as doors or entry points on a building. A port scan essentially checks these 'doors' to see if they're open or closed. By specifying a target IP address or a domain name, and a range of ports to scan (from a starting port to an ending port), you can gather information about potential vulnerabilities on the target. It's like checking which doors are locked or open in a house, helping you understand about vulnerabilities.",
  "ping_command": "Overview: \nPing command allows users to test network connectivity and latency to a specific host. When you ping a device, your computer sends out a small packet of data to the target IP address. The target device then responds, allowing you to measure the round-trip time and determine if the device is reachable."
